Description
============

This is a fork of the original  [QuicTLS](https://github.com/quictls/openssl). It is one of the [recommended](https://nginx.org/en/docs/quic.html)  SSL libraries with QUIC support.

Why this fork is needed?
--------------------

We always strive to make sure our tools and builds work as expected regardless of time.
When we use open-source libraries, we always try to use only official libraries or libraries with a high level of trust.
We are very dependent on open-source. We always try to use original libraries. But sometimes there are cases when the build breaks after updating the library. This is especially true for git repositories.
As insurance against this case, we offer the additional opportunity to use a tested version, even if it is outdated.


Why do we trust this implement?
